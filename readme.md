Barter System App - User stories

1. The Administrator

a) We should ask the users to sign up and login to the app so that they can be authentcated users.

b) We need to restrict the users to put an offer only one at a time so that their cannot be a mess in the
   request list.

2. User

a) The users need to see a section to see they need what to trade things with and what the people need.

b) If they got a good offer from someobody but they have no thing to give the Second user we should put an e-comerce website link to quickly 
   buy the thing and give to the user who needs and the user who's trading with him should get the thing he wanted so that their both needs 
   will fulfil.

c) The users who are trading with each other when our delievery persons delivers the package that they had traded the users must recieve a 
   msg in the app or on their SMS  that their package has delievered to each other.



   ------------- How should we work on the project ---------------


1 . Wee need to create a sign up and login page first.

2 . We should display an alert msg if the credentilas given are wrong.

3 . We should add a Modal in the code means whenever the new users who come to our app whwnever they click on sign up
    their should be a popped window so that it will look little professional.

2 . Then we should create a bottom tab that contains the trades and home page in the home page will put some different animations and the   
    e-comerce website logo and the link as mentioned up.

3 . In the trading tab we should display all the trades that have been requested through the database.

4 . We should put some css styles or some lottie animations to make the project little more attractive.
